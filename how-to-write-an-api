HOW TO WRITE AN API
***********************************

OVERVIEW

Public APIs allow other developers to build products that communicate with your product, and they can help increase both the quality and reach of your product. Facebook's "Like" button you see on almost every site today is an example of how Facebook's API increased activity on the social network. There are a lot of benefits to writing an API for your product even before you're ready to release a Public API.

The purpose of the Github document is to collaborate on topics that should be covered in a course that teaches someone how to write their own API.

GETTING STARTED

As of now, I am still working on the first draft. I hope to share this for collaboration once it's done. Thanks for the patience. Also, don't hesitate to suggest how I can do this better, since I've far from mastered Github.
